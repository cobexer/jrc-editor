Known bugs
----------

* The Java source parser is based upon JLS 1.2.x, so asserts, generics, and 
  such modern forms of inner classes may not recoginized cirrectly. As JRC 
  Editor uses strict source code validation it may produce exception.

* If no strings assumed during source parsing the empty key would be created
  by default rather error message.

* Jar import assumes all property files inside are belongs to one resource 
  bundle even if files have ddifferent code base.

* The JRC Editor have optimized to work with JDK/JRE 1.4, so workarounds fir
  older versions have removed.
